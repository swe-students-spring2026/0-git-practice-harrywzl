[I let Anthropic's Claude Cowork loose on my files, and it was both brilliant and scary](https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropic-claude-cowork-ai-file-management-test/)

This article about Claude Cowork really got me thinking about how far AI has come and whether I'm actually ready for it. The idea of letting an AI loose on my computer files is both exciting and nerve-wracking - I have so many folders that are complete messes, stuffed with PDFs and downloads I keep meaning to organize but never get around to. What struck me most was how the author had to immediately switch to test folders because they realized Claude would be reading through all their personal information, and that's exactly where I'd be too. It's one thing to chat with an AI, but letting it dig through your actual files feels like a different level of trust. Still, watching it successfully categorize hundreds of research papers and rename generic files based on their content was impressive, even if it kept crashing and running out of memory. I think what makes this interesting is that it's tackling a real problem, like we all have digital clutter we never deal with, but at $100 a month and with all these security concerns, I'm not sure most people are ready to hand over that kind of access to an AI just yet. Maybe in a few years when the technology is more mature and we've figured out better privacy safeguards, but for now it feels like a fascinating experiment that's still finding its footing.

### Adam's comment (aes10130)
I agree that the trust barrier is huge; I'd want clearer privacy controls before letting any AI touch my real files. I personally use AI Agents occassionally when I write code, and the transition was really quick. I was initially very weary of letting AI access my computer files, but then soon enough I gave it full access, even letting it run commands when it wants to. It's just so efficient it's hard not to.
